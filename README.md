## Introduction

**Brazooka** is an android app made for those who waste way too much time searching for the perfect movie/serie to watch during their free time, which game to play with their friends on the weekends, or even which interesting book they should read before going to bed. My app was created with the aim of making people's lives **easier** by reducing this tedious search time while also **promoting the culture of my country**.
